This is the initial commit of my first-ever Python project: a simple Battleship game.  The code is a bit rough around the edges, reflecting my early days of learning to code. However, it holds significant personal value as it marks the beginning of my programming journey. I'm sharing it to document my progress and to remember how far I've come.
